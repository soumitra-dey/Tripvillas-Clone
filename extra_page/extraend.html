    <h1 id="h1">Beach Properties in India
    </h1>
    <p id="p">India's beaches have something to offer for everyone- From the very commercial beaches around Calangute in Goa to pristine beaches further to the North and to the southern tip of Goa. Alibaug - a short ferry ride from Mumbai is also an unspoilt location frequently used as a playground by the rich and famous of India including big Industrialists, CEOs and Bollywood Stars. Kerala further south offers serene backwaters and wellness holidays for that more relaxed beach holiday. Feel free to browse the properties below - which are typically owned by wealthier Indians from the bigger cities. Email the owners direct and remember: Always pack suncreen!! The Indian sun can be harsh.</p>
